# Drumkit Project ~Â Javascript Advanced
This is the complete project for the course teaching Drumkit. Some code may be absent as it is only part of the course and not the final project.
The intent for this repository is to show how powerful code is by using DOM manipulation, and should not be seen as the one and only way to accomplish said task.
Use this only as a guide and experiment.
